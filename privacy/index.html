<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">6.4. </span><b>Authorized</b> <b>Personnel</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Our employees, agents, consultants, contractors, or other authorized personnel, may have access to user information as necessary in the normal course of our business.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">6.5. </span><b>Business Transfers</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. In some cases, we may choose to buy or sell assets. In these types of transactions, user information is typically one of the business assets that is transferred. Moreover, if the Service or Boon, or substantially all of its assets, were acquired, liquidated, or dissolved, user information would be one of the assets that is transferred.</span></p>

These widgets, such as a Facebook “Share” or “Like” button, are visible to you on the web page you visit. Integration between the Service and social media networks such as Facebook, Twitter and others may allow social media networks in which you participate to collect information about you, even when you do not explicitly activate the network’s application or widget. Please visit the applicable social media network’s privacy policy to better understand their data collection practices and choices they make available to you. The privacy policy of the social media network controls the collection, use and disclosure of all personal information transmitted to that network.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">6.10. </span><b>Push Notifications.</b> <span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Further, some of our games and mobile applications may send local notifications to a user’s device; however, local notifications operate differently from “push” notifications. Specifically, local notifications are messages delivered directly through the game or mobile application and do not require collection or use of your personal information (other than the use of device ID, if necessary, solely for the purpose of sending the local notification). Please note that you may opt-out of receiving local notifications by changing your device settings.</span></p>
<ol start="7">
<li><b> CHOICE AND OPT-OUT</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. We provide you the ability to exercise certain controls and choices regarding our collection, use and sharing of your information. </span></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">7.1. </span><b>Choice</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. In accordance with local law, your controls and choices may include:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">(a)</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">You may correct, update and delete your account information, as described below;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">(b)</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">You may change your choices for subscriptions and newsletters;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">(d)</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">You may choose whether you received targeted advertising from us or our partners.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">7.2.</span><b> Opt-out. </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">We may also use tracking technologies to collect information about your visits over time and across third-party services or other online services. The Network Advertising Initiative (the “</span><b>NAI</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">”) is a cooperative group of ad serving providers. The NAI has developed a set of privacy principles to which its members adhere.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">7.3.</span><b> Accessing and Correcting Your Information</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. If you have an account, you can help ensure that your contact information and preferences are accurate, complete, and up to date by logging in to your account or by emailing us at privacy@boon.ie. For other personal information we hold, we will provide you with access for any purpose including requesting that we correct the data if it is inaccurate or delete the data if we are not required to retain it by law or for legitimate business purposes. We may decline to process requests that are frivolous/vexatious, jeopardize the privacy of others, are extremely impractical, or for which access is not otherwise required by local law.</span></p>
<ol start="8">
<li><b></b> <b>SECURITY.</b></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">8.1. </span><b>Security Measures</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. We have put in place physical, electronic, and managerial procedures designed to help prevent unauthorized access, to maintain data security, and to use correctly the information we collect online. These safeguards vary based on the sensitivity of the information that we collect and store.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">8.2. </span><b>No Security Guarantees</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Although we take appropriate measures to safeguard against unauthorized disclosures of Information, we cannot assure you that Information will never be disclosed, altered or destroyed in a manner that is inconsistent with this Privacy Policy.</span></p>
<ol start="9">
<li><b></b> <b>CALIFORNIA PRIVACY RIGHTS AND DO NOT TRACK DISCLOSURES</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. If you are a California resident, you may have certain additional rights. </span></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">9.1. </span><b>Privacy Rights.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> California Civil Code Section 1798.83 permits you to request information regarding the disclosure of your Personal Information by us to third parties for the third parties’ direct marketing purposes. California Business and Professions Code Section 22581 permits registered users who are minors to request and obtain deletion of certain posted content. To make any such requests, please email us at privacy@boon.ie or contact us at the address below.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">9.2. </span><b>Do Not Track Disclosures</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. California Business &amp; Professions Code Section 22575(b) (as amended effective January 1, 2014) provides that California residents are entitled to know how we respond to “</span><b>Do Not Track</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">” browser settings. We do not currently take action to respond to Do Not Track signals because a uniform technological standard has not yet been developed. We continue to review new technologies and may adopt a standard once one is created.</span></p>
<ol start="10">
<li><b></b> <b>USERS FROM</b> <b>OTHER JURISDICTIONS</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">.

If you are not a resident of Ireland or you are located outside Ireland and choose to use the Service or provide information to us, please note that we will transfer the information, including Personal Information, to Ireland and process it there. Your acceptance of this Privacy Policy, followed by your submission of such information represents your agreement and consent to that transfer. We do not represent or warrant that the Service, or any portion thereof, are appropriate or available for use in any particular jurisdiction. Those who choose to access the Service do so on their own initiative and at their own risk, and are responsible for complying with all local laws, rules and regulations. We may limit the availability of the Service, in whole or in part, to any person, geographic area or jurisdiction that we choose, at any time and in our sole discretion.</span></li>
